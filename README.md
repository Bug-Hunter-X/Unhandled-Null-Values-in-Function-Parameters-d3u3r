This repository demonstrates an example of a common JavaScript bug involving the improper handling of null values passed as function parameters.  The bug is demonstrated in `bug.js`, and a solution is provided in `bugSolution.js`.  The main issue is that a simple check for null values is missing, leading to potential runtime errors if null values are inadvertently passed in.  The solution shows how to explicitly handle null values to prevent unexpected behavior.
